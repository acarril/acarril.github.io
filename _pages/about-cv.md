# About me

Before going to grad school I was a research assistant at the [NBER](http://www.nber.org/), where I worked with professor [Christopher Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io/) in several of his projects.
I also held the same position for two years at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac), working with Chris, as well as with professors [Dina Pomeranz](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/pomeranz.html), [Sebastián Bustos](https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/people/sebastian-bustos) and [Gabriel Zucman](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/), based in Chile and The Dominican Republic.
Before working as an RA, I was a high-school math and physics teacher at [Colegio Antares](http://www.colegioantares.cl/), a small school in the outskirts of Santiago, Chile. I did this as part of [Enseña Chile](https://www.ensenachile.cl/), an NGO that follows the [Teach for All](http://teachforall.org/) model.
