We know that $$R^2$$ is not relevant to quantile regression. In this post I explain why is that so and how can we measure "goodness of fit" using alternative measurements.

# Measuring goodness of fit

[Koenker and Machado (1999)](http://ajbuckeconbikesail.net/Econ616/Quantile/JASA1999.pdf) propose $$R^1(\tau)$$, a pseudo-$$R^2$$ which measures goodness of fit by comparing the sum of weighted deviations for the model of interest at the $$\tau$$ quantile with the same sum from a model in which only the intercept appears.

$$R_1(\tau) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{y_i \ge \hat y_i} \tau \cdot \vert y_i-\hat y_i \vert +\sum_{y_i<\hat y_i} (1-\tau) \cdot \vert y_i-\hat y_i \vert}{\sum_{y_i \ge \bar y} \tau \cdot \vert y_i-\bar y \vert +\sum_{y_i<\bar y_i} (1-\tau) \cdot \vert y_i-\bar y \vert},$$

where $$\hat y_i =\alpha_{\tau}+\beta_{\tau}x$$ is the fitted $$\tau$$th quantile for observation $$i$$, and $$\bar y=\beta_{\tau}$$ is the fitted value from the intercept-only model. $$R_1(\tau)$$ belongs to $$[0,1]$$, where 1 is a perfect fit, since the numerator (weighted sum of deviations) would be zero in such case.

Note that this is a *local* measure of fit for QRM since it depends on $$\tau$$, unlike the global $$R^2$$ from OLS. That is arguably the source of the warnings about using it: if you model fits in the tail, there's not guarantee that it fits well anywhere else.
This approach could also be used to compare nested models.
