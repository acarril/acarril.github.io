As Chris Blattman explains in a [blog post](https://chrisblattman.com/2011/11/15/if-you-know-what-ln1income-is-and-why-its-a-headache-you-should-read-this-post/), the main advantage of using an inverse hyperbolic sine transform instead of the usual (natural) log-transform on the dependent variable is that the former is defined for any real number, including those annoying zeroes and (and sometimes negative values) that our trusty logarithm just can't handle. In this post I'll explore this alternative transformation in greater depth.

# The log transform

Lets get this out of the way: are we talking about base 10 logarithms or natural logarithms? **In economics, almost always people write "logarithm" but they're actually referring to natural logarithms"**.

It baffles me that we economists keep saying "take the logarithm of household income" and keep writing $$\log{y}$$, when what we really mean is to take the *natural* logarithm of household income, $$\ln{y}$$. I honestly don't know why this has happened, but in this post (and in general) I will always refer to natural logarithms by their full name and correct notation.

### Why take take natural logs?
