abstract: 'The ability to accurately and reliably predict waiting times at walk-in hospital facilities can increase both patient satisfaction and hospital efficiency via a better management of patient flow. This paper studies the implementation of machine learning (ML) models to predict waiting times in the Emergency Room (ER) of the largest public hospital in Chile. Detailed administrative data on date and time, patient flow, and current and past examinations was provided by [Saltala](http://landing.saltala.com/), who developed a smartphone application for remote queuing. Several ML algorithms were evaluated to find the most accurate and useful prediction, including neural network, support vector machine, elastic net and multivariate adaptive regression splines. Elastic net performs best among a total of 8 explored models for predicting wait times, and the most important predictors are identified.'
