abstract: "Students loan programs are one of the leading policies for reducing the barriers to entry to higher education. There is growing evidence that access to credit is an effective way of promoting higher education and reducing the inequality in access. However, little has been said about how these massive demand-side subsidies might be affecting the supply-side of the market. This paper uses Chilean data on higher education institutions to analyze the extent to which the introduction of a large, government-backed student loan program potentially contributed to changes in the market structure of higher education. The proposed mechanism is that loans alleviate credit constraints, but consumers who are more sensitive to out-of-pocket price might also be less prepared and, importantly, less informed about the choices' net present value (NPV). In this scenario, introducing government-backed student loans might improve access to college, but in aggregate will make demand less sensitive to price and NPV, shifting incentives for higher education institutions."
