    Teacher allocation—both within and across schools—is a major source of inefficiency in school districts.
    The school teachers market is particular because teachers cannot freely supply any number of labor hours, because they also have to fit each school's schedule.
    These schedules are determined via a costly process which is inflexible and produces sub-optimal results.
    In this paper I investigate how inflexible scheduling of labor hours is an important source of frictions in the school market, which leads to inefficient assignment of teachers across school districts.

<!-- Teacher allocation ---both within and across schools--- is a major source of inefficiency in school districts.
The school teachers market is particular because teachers cannot freely supply any number of labor hours, because they also have to fit each school's schedule.
These schedules are determined via a costly process which is inflexible and produces sub-optimal results.
In this paper I investigate how inflexible scheduling of labor hours is an important source of frictions in the school market, which leads to inefficient assignment of teachers across school districts.

The teacher market is particular ---among other reasons--- for facing two seemingly unrelated problems.
First, solving the problem of school schedules is a very hard problem (as in NP-hard).
Schools have to invest a significant amount of resources to solve the problem, and the solution is nevertheless inflexible and sub-optimal in several dimensions.
In this paper I propose a solution to two inter-related problems in the teacher market.
At the school level, solving the teacher scheduling problem is an NP-hard problem -->
