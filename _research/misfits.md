title: Dealing with misfits in random treatment assignment
pubstatus: published
journal: 'Stata Journal 17, no. 3 (2017): 652-67'
abstract: 'In this article, I discuss the "misfits" problem, a practical issue that arises in random treatment assignment whenever observations cannot be neatly distributed among treatments. I also introduce the <code>randtreat</code> command, which performs random assignment of unequal treatment fractions and provides several methods to deal with misfits.'
