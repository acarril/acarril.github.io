abstract: 'In this article, I discuss the "misfits" problem, a practical issue that arises in random treatment assignment whenever observations cannot be neatly distributed among treatments. I also introduce the <code>randtreat</code> command, which performs random assignment of unequal treatment fractions and provides several methods to deal with misfits.'
