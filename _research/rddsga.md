abstract: 'In this article we introduce the rddsga command, which allows to conduct binary subgroup analysis in regression discontinuity designs. Observations in each subgroup are weighted by the inverse of their conditional probabilities to belong to that subgroup, given a set of covariates. Analyzing the differential treatment effect in the re-weighted sample helps to isolate the difference due to the subgroup characteristic of interest from other observable dimensions. This methodology is illustrated with a real example based on Meyersson (2014). We find that the threshold-crossing effect is only significant for one of the subgroups, and that the difference between both subgroups is underestimated when not correcting by inverse probability score weighting.'
