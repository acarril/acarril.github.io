I am an economist and data scientist at [Mercado Libre](https://investor.mercadolibre.com/about-meli).
Prior to joining Mercado Libre, I was a lecturer in statistics and econometrics at the [Princeton School of Public and International Affairs](https://spia.princeton.edu/). 
My research applies quantitative methods, drawing from econometrics, statistics, and machine learning, to better understand the decisions of people and firms.

I hold a PhD in economics from [Princeton](https://irs.princeton.edu/people/alvaro-carril), where I was also a [Social Data Science](https://ddss.princeton.edu/people/graduate-fellows-social-data-science) graduate fellow.
In parallel to my graduate studies, I was also a research affiliate and project manager at [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com/team).

Much of my work so far revolves around using economics and data science to better understand the decisions of people and firms. At ConsiliumBots, I led the design and implementation of different chatbots (like [OsoBot](https://yopuedoser.educacionbogota.edu.co/es/osobot-0)) that helped students make better-informed educational decisions. Part of this project is analyzed in my [job market paper](/carril_jmp.pdf), which uses multiple experiments to study the effects of different types of information on the choice of college loans.

Before graduate school I was a research assistant at the [NBER](http://www.nber.org/), where I worked with professor [Christopher Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io/) on different education projects that combined information, decision-making, and market design.
I also held the same position for two years at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac), working with Chris, as well as with professors [Dina Pomeranz](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/pomeranz.html), [Sebastián Bustos](https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/people/sebastian-bustos) and [Gabriel Zucman](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/), in both Chile and the Dominican Republic.
During this time I also helped [José de Gregorio](http://degregorio.cl/) revise the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of his Macroeconomics book.
Before working as an RA, I was a high-school math and physics teacher at [Colegio Antares](http://www.colegioantares.cl/), a small school in the outskirts of Santiago, Chile. This role came as a part of my involvement with [Enseña Chile](https://www.ensenachile.cl/), an NGO adhering to the [Teach for All](http://teachforall.org/) model.
