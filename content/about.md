I am a sixth-year PhD student in economics at [Princeton](https://irs.princeton.edu/people/alvaro-carril), a [Social Data Science](https://ddss.princeton.edu/people/graduate-fellows-social-data-science) graduate fellow, and a research affiliate at [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com/team).
I am also a consultant for the [IDB Education Sector](https://www.iadb.org/en/sector/education/overview).

I am interested the role that information plays in the decisions of people and firms.
Much of my research involves the use of chatbots and AI to understand people's decisions, and help them make better-informed choices.
Most of my projects are on the topic of education, and how the right information at the right time can help people make better educational choices.
I have carried out much of this work with amazing people at ConsiliumBots, developing chatbots in partnership with governments in Latin America.

Before going to grad school I was a research assistant at the [NBER](http://www.nber.org/), where I worked with professor [Christopher Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io/) on several of his projects.
I also held the same position for two years at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac), working with Chris, as well as with professors [Dina Pomeranz](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/pomeranz.html), [Sebastián Bustos](https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/people/sebastian-bustos) and [Gabriel Zucman](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/), in both Chile and the Dominican Republic.
During this time I also helped [José de Gregorio](http://degregorio.cl/) revise the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of his Macroeconomics book.
Before working as an RA, I was a high-school math and physics teacher at [Colegio Antares](http://www.colegioantares.cl/), a small school in the outskirts of Santiago, Chile. This role came as a part of my involvement with [Enseña Chile](https://www.ensenachile.cl/), an NGO adhering to the [Teach for All](http://teachforall.org/) model.
