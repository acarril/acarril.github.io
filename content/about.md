I'm a fifth-year [PhD student in Economics at Princeton](https://irs.princeton.edu/people/alvaro-carril). I study the role that information plays in the decisions of people and firms.

Most of my work is on the topic of education, and how the right information at the right time can help people make better educational decisions.
I've done much of this work with the team at [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com/), a non-profit that uses technology to help people make informed decisions.
