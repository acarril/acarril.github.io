## Initial setup

### macOS

As usual, my recommendation in macOS is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
If you don't care about compiling from source or managing different Julia versions, the easiest method to install the latest version of Julia is using a cask:

```zsh
brew install --cask julia
```

Alternatively, if you don't have Homebrew (you should), you can [download](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release) the `*.dmg` of the latest current stable release and install Julia as a normal application.
However, after installing it, you need to symlink the binary to some location present in your path (see [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#macos) for more info). This can be done with
```zsh
sudo ln -s /Applications/Julia-1.8.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia
```

Both of these methods are literally [the same](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/julia.rb).
Whichever you use, make sure you can invoke the Julia REPL by typing `julia` in your terminal without errors.

"""Test file for Python syntax highlighting in editors / IDEs.
Meant to cover a wide range of different types of statements and expressions.
Not necessarily sensical or comprehensive (assume that if one exception is
highlighted that all are, for instance).
Extraneous trailing whitespace can't be tested because of svn pre-commit hook
checks for such things.

## VS Code

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) support in VS Code is first class, and setting everything up is simple. Ditch that RAM-hogging, proprietary ~~Methlab~~ Matlab, and get ready to fly.
